# Welcome to smolarith's documentation!

`smolarith` is a library written in {doc}`Amaranth HDL <amaranth:cover>` that
provides soft-core arithmetic building blocks, such as multipliers and
dividers.

_If your FPGA or ASIC flow provides hard multiplier or divider IP, you should
probably favor that IP over this library._
