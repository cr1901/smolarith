## [Unreleased]


## [v0.1.1] - 2024-03-05

### Added
- Add [restoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm) divider
  internal implementation.

- Add [DoIt](http://pydoit.org/) tasks for benchmarking and Verilog generation.
  These are meant mostly for development.


### Changed
- The MulticycleDiv implementation has been simplified in two ways:
  
  - The internal divider and signed/unsigned conversion is now controlled by
    an FSM instead of streaming signed/unsigned units.

  - The internal divider uses a restoring algorithm by default.

  Net effect is that a 32-bit MulticycleDiv requires 12% fewer storage
  elements and 37% fewer LUTs.


### Fixed
- The internal NonRestoringDiv now requires one extra cycle of latency to
  latch inputs, so that inputs need not be held while a divide is in progress.
  
  This also has the side effect of reducing LUT usage at the cost of extra
  registers.


## [v0.1.0] - 2024-02-29

Initial release.

### Added

- Add multicycle multipier core, pipelined multiplier, and multicycle
  [long and non-restoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm) dividers.
  
  32 and 64-bit dividers created with this library are compliant w/
  [RISC-V specification](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/tag/Ratified-IMAFDQC)
  for division-by-zero, signed overflow, and remainder sign.
